# neuronal
This package can be used for performing Bayesian inference on spike times and peak amplitudes of neuronal signals from electrophysiological experiments. This package focuses on intracellular signals, such as postsynaptic signals (PSP) and action potentials (AP). This packages uses pymc3 to perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) calculations for parameter estimation and model comparison. 

This package is for Data Analysis for Physicists (PHYS 201), Spring 2019, Harvard University.
