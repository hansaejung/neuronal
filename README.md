# neuronal
This package can be used for performing Bayesian inference on spike times and peak amplitudes of neuronal signals from electrophysiology experiments. This package focuses on postsynaptic potentials (PSP) from intracellular measurements. This packages uses pymc3 to perform Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) calculations for parameter estimation. 

This package is for Data Analysis for Physicists (PHYS 201), Spring 2019, Harvard University.
